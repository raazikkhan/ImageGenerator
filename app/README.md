Image Generator App 📸

A simple image generator app built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and an API to fetch and display images based on user input.

🚀 Features

✅ Generate images dynamically using an external API
✅ Responsive and modern UI with Tailwind CSS
✅ User-friendly input field for entering search queries
✅ Fast and smooth experience with React.js

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	React.js - For building the user interface
	•	Tailwind CSS - For styling the app
	•	API - To fetch images dynamically

📦 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-generator-app.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder

cd image-generator-app

3️⃣ Install dependencies

npm install

4️⃣ Start the development server

npm start

The app will run on http://localhost:3000/.

🔧 How It Works
	1.	The user enters a search query (e.g., “mountains”, “cats”).
	2.	The app sends a request to the API to fetch related images.
	3.	The fetched images are displayed in a grid layout.
	4.	Clicking on an image opens it in full size (optional).

📸 API Used
	•	The app fetches images from a third-party API like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay.
	•	If you’re using an API key, add it to a .env file:

REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

🎨 Customization
	•	Modify tailwind.config.js to customize styles.
	•	Change API endpoints in ImageGallery.js to fetch from a different source.
